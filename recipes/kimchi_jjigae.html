            <ul>
                <li>Pork cut (shoulder or neck), 130g</li>
                <li><i>Shin-kimchi</i> ("aged kimchi"), 390g </li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Cooking</h3>
            <ol class="text-block">
                <li>After making rice, keep 3 cups worth of the water after the 2nd or 3rd rinse. This water helps keep flavour within the dish and is very easy to make. You can also choose to make a <i>dashi</i> instead, or even fry and boil the pork first to create a stock.</li>
                <li>Dice the <i>Shin-kimchi</i>. <i>Shin-kimchi</i>> is key when making <i>kimchi-jjigae</i>. It is often translated as "aged kimchi", and typically refers to <i>kimchi</i> that has soured somewhat. This strong flavour is really essential for the soup. As Chef Paik Jong Won says, you can actually simulate the taste at home even if you don't have it by mixing a bit of vinegar with your kimchi after chopping it. </li>
                <li>Start by cooking the pork first, then as it browns begin to add the water. Add the <i>seyu-jeot</i> at this stage to help flavour the stock.</li>
                <li>Simmer for about 20 minutes. Doll out any fat or scum that rises to the top of the soup.</li>
                <li>Add <i>shin-kimchi</i>, garlic, and soy sauce. Make sure to use soup soy sauce, not table soy sauce: the latter is a lot weaker and more diluted, and you will need more of it to flavour the soup.</li>
                <li>After a few minutes, add the <i>gochugaru</i>> to the soupo.</li>
                <li>Finally, when it's ready, add green onion and hot pepper if you wish.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
