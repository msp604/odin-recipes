        <h1>Mandu</h1>

        <p class="text-block">Of all of the foods in Korea, <i>mandu</i> might be the one closest to my heart. A simple dish, made by mixing ground meat, chives, and other garnishings together, wrapping it in a wheat-based dough, then either steaming or frying it. <i>Mandu</i> stands are everywhere in Korea. It is one of the easiest street foods to get: whether it be on the way to work, on the way home from work, after a long night out, or early in the morning for a quick breakfast. <i>Mandu</i> is most often made at home however, and interestingly it is often quite a communal dish: parents will often get children to help them fill and wrap <i>mandu</i>, making it even more delicious as everyone knows they worked hard to make it together. The steps for making <i>mandu</i> begin quite simple, though of course the maker has the option to dial up or tone down the complexity, depending on what they want to cook with it. For this recipe, we're going to simplify things and use a very basic filling ingredient for <i>gogi mandu</i> (meat dumplings).</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul class="text-block">
                    <li>50 <i>mandu</i> skins (easily purchasable at any Korean grocery store)</lI>
                    <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
                    <li>4 ounces of soft tofu, drained and chopped</li>
                    <li>1 bunch of chives, chopped</li>
                    <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1-2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1-2 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil</li>
                    <li>3-4 tablespoons salt and pepper</li>
                    <li>3-4 fine and coarse <i>gochugaru</i></li>
                    <li>3-4 tablespoons of granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>all purpose flour for dusting</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol class="text-block">
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix all of the ingredients together. It's important to mix thoroughly to combine, but if you're squeamish about touching the mixture, grab some disposible gloves and use them when mixing (common in Korea).</li>
                    <li>Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for an hour in the refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and lightly sprinkle them with flour.</li>
                    <li>Fill a small bowl with water</li>
                    <li>Take out the mix and lay a dumpling skin flat on your palm. Place one tablespoon of the mixture at the center of the dumpling: fold the wrapper in half, pinching the edges to seal it. If you wish to make <i>wang mandu</i> (pictured above), pinch the edges together then bring both pointy ends together to make a half-moon shape.</li>
                    <li>Continue until finished. You can opt to steam them (5-7 minutes) or freeze them if you wish to keep them for later. In the latter case, it is a good idea to freeze them on a pan first then transfer them to a plastic container.</li>
                    <li>When steaming mandu, ensure they reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees and serve hot!</li>
