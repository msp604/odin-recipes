        <h2>Description</h2>       
            <p>If you think about the most popular Japanese foods in Canada, a few come to mind. Ramen. Sushi. Donburi. Yakisoba. But you may be surprised to know that none of these foods are the most popular in Japan. That honour belongs with <i>soba</i>, one of Japan's oldest and most treasured dishes. This simple but satisfying meal is named for its chief ingredient, <i>soba</i> (そば) or buckwheat, and is both delicious and simple to make!</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>There are two sets of ingredients you'll need for <i>soba</i>: one for the <i>dashi</i>, the special broth used for dipping <i>soba</i>, and one for the noodles themselves.</p>
            <p>For the broth, you will need the following items:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>600 ml water (2 servings)</li>
                    <li><i>Konbu</i> (dried kelp)</li>
                    <li><i>Katsuobushi</i> (dried bonito flakes)</li>
                    <li><i>Iriko</i> (dried anchovies)</li>
                    <li>Dried <i>Shitake</i> Mushrooms (dried shitake mushrooms)</li>
                    <li>Cooking <i>Sake</i> (1 tbsp)</li>
                    <li><i>Mirin</i> (2 tbsp)</li>
                    <li>Soy Sauce (2 tbsp)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the noodles, you simply need to purchase dried soba noodles from any mart that sells them. They are packaged in bunches, and one bunch is sufficient to feed one person!</p>        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Making the <i>Dashi</i></h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Add <i>konbu</i>, <i>iriko</i>, <i>dried shitake mushrooms</i> to 4 cups of water, heat on medium-low.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clean <i>dash</i> by skimming the foam and debris from the surface.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove <i>konbu</i>> just before leaves starting boiling, roughly after 10 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add <i>katsuobushi</i>, turn up heat until boiling, simmer for 30s, then turn off the heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the <i>katsuobushi</i> sinks to the bottom, strain and add <i>mirin</i>>, <i>soy sauce</i>, and <i>cooking sake</i>.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Cooking Soba</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Boil water and add soba when hot, cooking for 3-5 minutes. Don't overboil or it will lose its firmness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove from the water and place into a bowl of ice-cold water until noodles are cold to the touch (3-5 minutes).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set aside two plates, each with green onion garnish and a pinky-finger's worth of wasabi.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fill bowls with <i>dashi</i> sauce.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Plate, serve, and enjoy!
                    </li>
